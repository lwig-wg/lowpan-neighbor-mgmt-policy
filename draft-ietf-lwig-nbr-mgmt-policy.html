<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">In a wireless multihop network, the node densities (maximum number of devices connected on a single hop) may vary significantly depending upon deployments/scenarios. While there is some policy control possible with regards to the network size in terms of maximum number of devices connected, it is especially difficult to set a figure on what will be the maximum node density given a deployment.  For e.g. A network can put an upper limit on max 1000 devices but it is impossible to state what the node density will be in this 1000 node network. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">A neighbor cache is used for populating neighboring one-hop connected nodes information such as MAC address, link local IP address and other reachability state information. Node density has direct implications on the neighbor cache and in constrained network scenario the size of the neighbor cache will be limited. Thus there are chances that a node may not be able to fit all the neighboring nodes in its cache in which case it has to prioritize entries and thus needs a neighbor management policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This draft presents problems related to neighbor management policies by considering a security-enabled multi-hop 6lo network. This document considers RPL <a href="#RFC6550" class="xref">[RFC6550]</a> as a routing protocol and PANA (EAP-PANA) <a href="#RFC5191" class="xref">[RFC5191]</a> as a network access protocol. For RPL, both the storing and non-storing mode of operations are considered. We also provide a sample neighbor management policy which can be used in such networks and its limitations. The aim of such a policy is to retain set of neighbor cache entries with high quality links such that routing adjacencies are stablized.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">The problem statement and the proposed solution described is also relevant to other multihop constrained scenarios such as 6TiSCH <a href="#I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture]</a>. <a href="#I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal-security]</a> talks about a pledge (new joinee) node authenticating via a Join Proxy. The considerations mentioned in this document are applicable for such networks as well.</p>

<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Requirements Language and Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">PaC (PANA Client): New joining node which is yet to be authenticated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">PRE (PANA Relay Element): An already authenticated and network joined node which is willing to act as a relay element for PaCs to complete their authentication procedure on multi-hop networks.  <a href="#RFC6345" class="xref">[RFC6345]</a> describes the details of PRE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">PAA (PANA Auth Agent): Auth server which hosts the credentials database. PaC will handshake with PAA to complete authentication procedure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">Routing Child: A downstream node who is part of the routing table of the parent. For e.g. in the sample topology above N5 is the directly connected routing child for N3.  N6 and N7 are also part of N3 routing table, they are routing child nodes but not directly connected. For N6 and N7 the document might alternatively use a term grand-child.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Routing Parent: In <a href="#sample_top" class="xref">Figure 1</a>, N1 and N2 are possible routing parents for N3.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE): A neighbor entry managed on behalf of directly connected peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.8">This document also uses terminology described in <a href="#RFC6550" class="xref">[RFC6550]</a> and <a href="#RFC6775" class="xref">[RFC6775]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">

</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> Significance of Neighbor management policy</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">Multihop mesh networks present unique challenges to neighbor management especially with resource constrained nodes. In cases where the node density is higher that the neighbor cache size, the entries have to be prioritized. <a href="#Woo_et_al" class="xref">[Woo_et_al]</a> and <a href="#Dawans_et_al" class="xref">[Dawans_et_al]</a> talk about prioritization of neighbor entries by using link quality estimation techniques. But prioritization alone may not necessarily be optimal in all cases.  The reason or function why neighbor entry was added also needs to be taken in consideration. For example, evicting a routing direct child might have a ripple effect in turn impacting all the sub-childs as well.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">In case of key management protocols deployed above MAC layer in multihop network, the neighbor management kicks in early even before the routing adjacencies are established. Since a new joining node needs to discover/attach to a relay element for completing its authentication procedure, the neighbor cache entries have to be appropriately populated both on a PaC and on the PRE. If a neighbor entry whose authentication is in progress is evicted, it will negatively impact the authentication procedure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">Another important consideration is that with increased node density, the prioritization based on link estimation parameters might not help since there might be more well connected peers. In dense deployments the number of directly attached neighbors with good quality links might still be higher than the max entries in neighbor cache size.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Trivial neighbor management policies</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.1">This section investigates policies which are used by most of the current operating systems for constrained nodes. While such policies are trivial to implement they may not be able to deal with the constrained network scenario. Note that such policies can still be used if it is known apriori that the neighbor cache can hold entries for maximum node density.</p>
<p></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First Come First Serve (FCFS) policy</li>
<li>Least Recently Used (LRU) policy</li>
</ol>

<p> The primary distinction between these policies is how it treats a new entry when the neighbor cache is full. In case of FCFS policy, the new entry is simply rejected while with LRU, the new entry replaces the least recently used entry.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.3">RPL works by initiating a downstream multicast DIO to establish upstream network path. Subsequently DAO messages might be sent by the nodes to establish downstream paths to the nodes. Thus the network is flooded with multicast DIO messages initially and similarly there are chances that the same node is ended up been selected as a preferred parent by most of the child nodes and thus receives a DAO message from all these child nodes. Note that once a node establishes a parent entry or a routing entry on behalf of a directly connected node then it has to also provision a neighbor cache entry for it for subsequent unicast traffic.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.4">In case of FCFS policy, a node might end up hosting all the neighbor entries based on DIO or DAO messages.  Once the cache is full all the subsequent attempts to add an NCE will fail.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.p.5">In case of LRU policy, a node might end up churning lot of neighbor entries because once the cache gets full and there is a request for new entry, it would result in evicting the least recently used (but active) entry.  If at later point of time, there is a traffic for the evicted entry then the old entry has to be reinstated using IPv6 NDP procedure. This would mean reinstating the entry by evicting another least recently used entry. If the node density is very high, then this churn would be substantially high to extent that it would disrupt any routing adjacencies to be established in the network in a stable way. </p>

One example would be when the node receives a DAO message from its immediate child node, it not only makes an addition to the routing table but also creates a neighbor cache entry for the node. Thus it eliminates need for additional IPv6 NDP NS/NA messaging involved to resolve MAC address. Similar hueristic is used to add neighbor entries in other cases as well.

This is needed since the source routing header carries the global addresses and thus the NCE of the child node should contain the global address.  Secondly, the RPL DAO is addressed directly to the root node in case of non-storing mode. Thus RPL messaging cannot be used for creating NCE entries on parent and child, unlike storing MOP.  The child node may send a secure unicast NS with ARO option containing its global address to be registered on the parent node.

<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.2">Route Invalidation: In case of storing MOP, when the child node decides to switch its preferred parent, the RPL specifications allows the node to send a no-path DAO message to invalidate the route along the previous path(s). A directly connected parent node can use this message to clear the NCE.  While the entry can be immediately cleared, usually the implementations choose to wait a small amount of time before clearing the entry.  This is to avoid any impact on the in-transit traffic. Thus this also establishes the importance of route invalidation to achieve optimized neighbor cache utilization. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.2.p.3">In case of non-storing mode, the no-path DAO cannot be not employed since the previous parent does not having any routing information to be invalidated. But the previous parent may still contain the NCE on behalf of the child node. This document recommends use of <a href="#RFC6775" class="xref">[RFC6775]</a> section 6.5.3. which allows sending a zero lifetime ARO option in NS for deregistering the corresponding neighbor entry.</p>
<p><a href="#RFC6775" class="xref">[RFC6775]</a>, ND optimizations for 6LoWPANs, section 5.5.3. talks about deleting the entries in case the NUD (neighbor unreachability detection) fails either due to no response to NS messages or due to failure response. NCEs in such cases should be deleted. An example where NUD NS would fail because of no response is the case where the child node switches its parent due to link unavailability. The parent in such a case would not receive the no-path DAO message or any other traffic from the child node. Thus on NCE lifetime expiry, the parent node would send NS which would fail with no response, thus triggering entry deletion.  </p>

In the sample topology <a href="#sample_top" class="xref">Figure 1</a>, lets assume N3 needs to evict N5 from its neighbor cache. In case of RPL's storing MOP, eviction of directly connected routing child NCE also has impact on all the sub-children. Thus not only will it result in impacting N5 but also nodes N6 and N7. It is important to note that such an eviction has less impact on RPL's non-storing MOP i.e. in case of non-storing mode N5 might end up selecting alternate parent N8 and does not result in any additional control overhead for node N6 and N7.  </p>

With wireless networks, the neighbor cache entries prioritization may change over a period of time especially the link quality estimation parameters or the routing metrics.  Reinforcement refers to updating the parameters in context to the NCEs which helps in prioritizing the entries when it comes to handling eviction. In wireless networks, on reception of incoming packet, the receiver node's physical and MAC layer may derive certain signal reception parameters (such as RSSI, LQI) which can be considered for reinforcement purpose if the corresponding transmitter/source entry in neighbor cache is found. It should be noted that the signal quality parameters may have high variance in 6lo networks and thus statistical techniques (such as weighted averaging) are usually employed for deciding about a link quality over a period of time.  Reinforcement can be achieved using one or more of the following techniques: </p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.5.2.p.2">Currently there is no standard way of signaling such neighbor cache space availability information.

One such case is where a child node may have a given parent node as its only parent and that parent node's NCE are all used up. In such a case, the child node would keep on retrying and failing to send a DAO through the parent node. Ideally the parent node could have evicted a least used child node or a child node who has an alternate parent available. Evicting such a child node is a complex process and may increase the control overhead as described in <a href="#dc_eviction" class="xref">Section 2.3.3.1</a>.  Thus the reservation based policy requires that the minimum node density is sufficiently high so that every child finds a parent node in its vicinity with enough resources.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The Join Relay or the PANA Relay Element allows the un-authenticated nodes to join the network. Since the NS/NA signaling is unencrypted, it is possible that a malicious node may try spoof and occupy all the entries. This draft explains the use of reservation based policy for managing such entries. Following points try to reduce the impact of such attacks: Only a subset of entries are reserved for un-authenticated nodes.  </p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Only a subset of entries are reserved for un-authenticated nodes doing plain-text NS/NA </li>
<li>It is recommended that NCE timeout be configured a lower value to evict such entries as soon as possible. New joining nodes are supposed to use these entries and thus are only needed during the time the authentication is in progress. Thus a short-duration NCE timeout will help reduce the impact of DoS attacks.  </li>
